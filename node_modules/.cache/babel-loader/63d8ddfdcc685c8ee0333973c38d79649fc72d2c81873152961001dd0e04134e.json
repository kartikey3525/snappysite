We burn out coils using a pollution-controlled furnace at carefully regulated temperatures. We remove bad coils and blast the core clean using non-destructive media to prevent excessive efficiency losses. Motors that are highly contaminated with oil or grease within the laminations receive pressure-cleaning at a high temperature with an industrial alkaline-based degreaser.</p><p>A winding technician then makes new coils using only VFD-rated magnet wire. VFD-shielded wire is essential because motors that run with a VFD are subject to more electrical stress than motors that use a starter.
